# Change Log

## 1.0.0-rc.2

### Patch Changes

- [#2034](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/2034) [`5768cc60`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/5768cc604dc7fcb2c95165399180179d406bb257) - Reverts the change in Lit 2 to pause ReactiveElement's update cycle while the element is disconnected. The update cycle for elements will now run while disconnected as in Lit 1, however AsyncDirectives must now check the `this.isConnected` flag during `update` to ensure that e.g. subscriptions that could lead to memory leaks are not made when AsyncDirectives update while disconnected.

## 1.0.0-rc.1 - 2021-04-20

### Added

- Added `render-global` module for non-sandboxed rendering.

- Added `elementRenderers` option to `RenderInfo`, along with `static matchesClass()` method to `ElementRenderer`, allowing the default renderer(s) to be overridden.

- Added `defer-hydration` attribute handling, which helps coordinate ordered wakeup of custom elements during hydration.
