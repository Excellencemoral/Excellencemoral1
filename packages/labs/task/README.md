# @lit-labs/task

A controller for Lit that renders asynchronous tasks.

This package has graduated from labs! It is now available as `@lit/task`. This package will no longer be updated, but it will continue to work and get updates through the ^1.0.0 version range of `@lit/task` because it's now just a re-export of that package. This should reduce duplication of code while everyone migrates their imports and dependencies.

If you're looking at this locally or on GitHub, you can now find the README here: [README.md](../../task/README.md).

If you're looking at this online, you can also find its README on npmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/task
