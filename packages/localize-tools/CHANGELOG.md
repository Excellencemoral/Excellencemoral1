## Unreleased

### Changed

- Bumped dependency versions for `xmldom` and `@lit/localize`

## [0.1.0] - 2021-03-24

### Changed

- Initial release of `@lit/localize-tools` package. This new package provides
  the `lit-localize` binary, while `@lit/localize` continues to provide the
  browser library (`msg`, `LocalizedElement`, etc.).

- **BREAKING** `lit-localize` now uses JS modules instead of CommonJS, so it
  requires Node 14 or higher.
