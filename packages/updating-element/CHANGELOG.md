## Unreleased

### Changed

- Errors that occur during the update cycle were previously squelched to allow subsequent updates to proceed normally. Now errors are re-fired asynchronously so they can be detected. Errors can be observed via an `unhandledrejection` event handler on window.

### Added

- UpdatingElement moved from `lit-element` package to `updating-element` package.
