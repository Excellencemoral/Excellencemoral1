## Unreleased

### Changed

- Errors that occur during the update cycle were previously squelched to allow subsequent updates to proceed normally. Now errors are re-fired asynchronously so they can be detected. Errors can be observed via an `unhandledrejection` event handler on window.

- UpdatingElement's `renderRoot` is now created when the element's `connectedCallback` is initially run.

### Added

- Added ability to add a controller to an element. A controller can implement callbacks that tie into element lifecycle, including `connectedCallback`, `disconnectedCallback`, `willUpdate`, `update`, and `updated`. To ensure it has access to the element lifecycle, a controller should be added in the element's constructor. To add a controller to the element, call `addController(controller)`.

- Added `willUpdate(changedProperties)` lifecycle method to UpdatingElement. This is called before the `update` method and can be used to compute derived state needed for updating. This method is intended to be called during server side rendering and should not manipulate element DOM.

- UpdatingElement moved from `lit-element` package to `updating-element` package.

### Fixed

- Fixes an issue with `queryAssignedNodes` when applying a selector on a slot that included text nodes on older browsers not supporting Element.matches [#1088](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/1088).
