## Unreleased

### Changed

- Errors that occur during the update cycle were previously squelched to allow subsequent updates to proceed normally. Now errors are re-fired asynchronously so they can be detected. Errors can be observed via an `unhandledrejection` event handler on window.

### Added

- UpdatingElement moved from `lit-element` package to `updating-element` package.

### Fixed

- Fixes an issue with `queryAssignedNodes` when applying a selector on a slot that included text nodes on older browsers not supporting Element.matches [#1088](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/1088).
