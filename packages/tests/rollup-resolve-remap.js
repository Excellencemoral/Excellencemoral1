/**
 * Rollup plugin that remaps import module specifiers.
 *
 * Similar to @rollup/plugin-alias, but different in that it works better with
 * relative path module specifiers, not just bare module specifiers.
 *
 * Instead of applying substitutions directly to the original module specifier
 * as @rollup/plugin-alias does, we instead first run the standard module
 * resolver, giving us a fully qualified path to a module on disk. We then apply
 * the given substutitions to that path. This way, the paths we substitute are
 * always normalized and relative to a given root directory.
