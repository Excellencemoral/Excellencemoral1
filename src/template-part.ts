/**
 * A placeholder for a dynamic expression in an HTML template.
 *
 * There are two built-in part types: AttributePart and NodePart. NodeParts
 * always represent a single dynamic expression, while AttributeParts may
 * represent as many expressions are contained in the attribute.
 *
 * A Template's parts are mutable, so parts can be replaced or modified
 * (possibly to implement different template semantics). The contract is that
 * parts can only be replaced, not removed, added or reordered, and parts must
 * always consume the correct number of values in their `update()` method.
 *
 * TODO(justinfagnani): That requirement is a little fragile. A
 * TemplateInstance could instead be more careful about which values it gives
 * to Part.update().
