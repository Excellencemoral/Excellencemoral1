# What is lit-html?

lit-html is an HTML templating library. Templates are written in JavaScript by mixing static HTML strings and dynamic JavaScript values using template literals. lit-html enables UI as a function of application state programming model, fast initial rendering, and fast updates that minimally update DOM when state changes.

lit-html is very performant as can be seen in the [JS Frameworks Benchmark](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/). A great companion to this document is [Justin Fagnani's lit-html talk](https://youtu.be/Io6JjgckHbg).

# Foundational Pieces

lit-html's design arises naturally out of combining two powerful web primitives: [JavaScript Tagged Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates) (TTLs) and the HTML [`<template>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) element.

TTLs provide an explicit syntax for separating static strings of HTML content and dynamic JavaScript values. The static strings are immutable and preserve identity across multiple evaluations of the tagged literal making them ideal for use as a cache key.

The `<template>` element provides a container for HTML content that can later be cloned into the document. In a template element: scripts don't run, styles don't apply, custom elements don't upgrade, etc. During rendering, a template's content can be cloned or imported into the Document which makes the cloned nodes active.

# Rendering

## Summary of lit-html rendering phases

lit-html templates are only a description of the UI. They must be rendered with `render()` to affect the DOM. The **Define** and **Render** phases are controlled by the user of Lit, while **Prepare**, **Create**, and **Update** are internal phases.

<ol>
<li>

**Define**: `` const ui = (title) => html`<h1>${title}</h1>` ``

</li>
<li>

**Render**: `render(ui("Example Title"), document.body)`

</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>

**Prepare**: The first time render is called for each unique TTL, create a `<template>` element containing the static HTML and Lit `TemplatePart`s encoding a mapping for each dynamic JavaScript value to its location in the static HTML.

</li>
<li>

**Create**: The first time render is called for a given node and template, clone the `<template>` contents into the DOM and instantiate the Lit `Part`s which manage the dynamic content.

</li>

<li>

**Update**: Iterate over the dynamic JS values and associated Lit `Part` only committing the values that have changed to the DOM.

</li>
</ol>
</ol>

The end result is `<h1>Example Title</h1>` rendered in the `<body>` element. If the user now executes `render(ui("Updated"), document.body)`, only the **Update** phase runs skipping the **Prepare** and **Create** phases.

## Motivating example

This example will be referred to throughout the rest of the document to concretely show what lit-html is doing during each internal rendering phase.

```html
<!-- File: index.html -->
<script type="module" src="./example.js"></script>
<style>
  .odd {
    color: green;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
</style>

<div id="container"></div>
```

```js
// File: example.js
import {html, render} from 'lit';

const container = document.querySelector('#container');

const counterUi = (count) => html` <span class="${count % 2 == 1 ? 'odd' : ''}">
    ${count}
  </span>
  <button @click=${() => render(counterUi(count + 1), container)}>
    Increment
  </button>`;

render(counterUi(0), container);
```

[Live example hosted on lit.dev.](https://lit.dev/playground/#gist=a1058bae08d79928fc2fafaf02b04581)

The sample code results in a counter which increments when the "Increment" button is clicked:

![Gif showing a counter and increment button. Clicking the button increments the counter. Odd numbers are green and underlined.](../images/how-lit-html-works/how-lit-works-demo.gif)

## 1. Define

Templates are defined with the `html` template tag. This tag does very little work â€” it only captures the current values and a reference to the strings object, and returns this as a `TemplateResult`.

lit-html ships with two template tags: `html` and `svg`. The `svg` tag is for defining SVG _fragment_ templates: it ensures that the elements created are in the SVG namespace.

The default `html` and `svg` tags are extremely simple, capturing the static strings and dynamic values in an object literal:

```js
const tag =
  (type) =>
  (strings, ...values) => ({
    ['_$litType$']: type,
    strings,
    values,
  });
const html = tag(/* HTML_RESULT type:*/ 1);
const svg = tag(/* SVG_RESULT type:*/ 2);
```

The first `render()` call in the sample defines the initial UI state as `counterUi(0)`, which when inlined into the sample code becomes:

```js
// The `counterUi(0)` expression evaluates to:
html`
  <span class="${""}">
   ${0}
  </span>
  <button @click=${
    () => render(counterUi(1), container)
  }>
    Increment
  </button>`;

// Then the `html` tag function expression evaluates to the following TemplateResult:
{
  ["_$litType$"]: 1,
  strings: [
    '<span class="',
    '">',
    '</span><button @click=',
    '>Increment</button>'
  ],
  values: [
    "",
    0,
    () => render(counterUi(1), container)
  ]
}
```

Evaluating a template expression is fast. It's only as expensive as the JavaScript expressions in the template, a function call and an object allocation.

## 2. Render

Initiated by a call to lit-html's `render()` function, such as: `render(counterUi(0), container)` in the example.

The `render()` function looks for a field `_$litPart$` on the container element or instantiates and assigns a new `ChildPart` on the container. Calling `_$setValue` on the container's `ChildPart` kicks off rendering on the passed in `TemplateResult`.

### 2.i. Prepare

Source: [`_$getTemplate` method which contains and caches the **Prepare** phase](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/5659f6eec2894f1534be1a367c8c93427d387a1a/packages/lit-html/src/lit-html.ts#L1562-L1568).

When a unique `TemplateResult` is rendered for the very first time on the page it must be prepared. The end result of the preparation phase is an instance of the Lit `Template` class that contains a `<template>` element (within `el` class field) and a list of `TemplateParts` (stored in the `parts` class field). This Lit `Template` object is cached by the `TemplateResult`'s unique `strings` template strings array so this phase is skipped if the `TemplateResult` is ever encountered again.

The returned value from `_$getTemplate` after the **Prepare** phase has completed for the sample code is:

```js
// Pseudo-code of the Prepare phase:
let preparedTemplate = ChildPart._$getTemplate(counterUi(0));

// Result of the Prepare phase:
console.log(preparedTemplate.el.outerHtml);
// <template><span><!--?lit$1234$--></span><button>Increment</button></template>

console.log(preparedTemplate.parts);
/*
[
  { type: 1, index: 0, name: "class" },
  { type: 2, index: 1 },
  { type: 1, index: 2, name: "click" }
]
*/
```

The following sections detail what happens in the constructor of the `Template` class
when preparing a `TemplateResult` for the first time:

#### Join the template's string literals with marker strings.

Source: [lit-html.ts `getTemplateHtml` function](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/5d68be35c192e8c4109911eec727fbb598557f72/packages/lit-html/src/lit-html.ts#L667)

We have a list of static HTML strings, but these cannot be directly inserted into a `<template>` element. This pass converts the immutable template strings array into an annotated HTML string where the returned HTML marks the dynamic parts of the HTML with the following annotations:

- Expressions in text position (e.g. `<span>${}</span>`), are marked with a comment node: `<span><!--?lit$random$--></span>`.
- Expressions in attribute position (e.g. `<p class="${}"></p>`), are marked with a sentinel string: `<p class$lit$="lit$random$"></p>`, and the attribute name has the suffix `$lit$` appended.

The suffix `$lit$` is appended to bound attributes so special-cased attributes (e.g., `style`, `class`, and many SVG attributes) aren't handled by the browser at a point when they contain marker expressions. For instance, IE and Edge parse the `style` attribute value and discard it if it's invalid CSS.

The prepared HTML string for the example's template strings array is:

```js
getTemplateHtml([
  '<span class="',
  '">',
  '</span><button @click=',
  '>Increment</button>',
]);

// Which returns the following (spaces added for readability):
[
  `<span class$lit$="lit$1234$">
    <?lit$1234$>
  </span>
  <button @click$lit$=lit$1234$>
    Increment
  </button>`,
  ['class', '@click'],
];
```

Notice that there are three markers that are associated with the example's three dynamic values contained in the `TemplateResult`'s `values` array.

#### Create a `<template>` element

The prepared HTML string is used to set the `innerHTML` of a new `<template>` element. This causes the browser to parse the template HTML. The prepared `<template>` element is assigned to `Template.el`.

> **Note**
> In the prepared example HTML string above, the syntax `<?lit$1234$>` represents a [`ProcessingInstruction`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ProcessingInstruction) and is parsed and inserted into the `<template>` element as the comment node: `<!--?lit$1234$-->`. This is an optimization to reduce the number of bytes per dynamic annotation.

This step is safe from XSS vulnerabilities or other malicious input because only the static strings are used and no dynamic values are inserted. Furthermore the `<template>` element only holds HTML, so scripts don't run, styles don't apply, custom elements don't upgrade, etc.

#### Create the `TemplateParts`

A `TemplatePart` is metadata storing where a dynamic JavaScript value should be set on the DOM. Each `TemplatePart` contains the depth-first index of the node it is associated with, along with the type of expression (`'text'` or `'attribute'`) and the name of the attribute.

`TemplateParts` are found by walking the tree of nodes in the `<template>` element and finding the marker annotations. If a marker is found, either in an attribute, as a marker comment node, or in text content, a `TemplatePart` is created and stored in the `parts` class field.

When traversing the tree of nodes, `Template` does different work for specific Node types:

##### Element

For each attribute on the element, if it has a `$lit$` suffix, then the expression represents either a `PropertyPart`, `BooleanAttributePart`, `EventPart`, or `AttributePart`. These can be distinguished by the first character in the attribute name ([see Appendix Parts table](#parts)).

An attribute on the element may also represent an `ElementPart` in the case where the attribute name starts with the marker sentinel value. E.g. `<div ${} ${}>` is marked up as `<div lit$random$0="" lit$random$1="">`.

For each of the bound attributes identified, they are removed from the element and a `TemplatePart` is created to record the location, name, and type of dynamic binding.

##### Comment

A Comment is usually either an expression marker, or a user-written comment with no expression associated. Occasionally though a user may have written an expression inside a comment. This is especially easy to do with IDEs that help comment out code sections and are inline-html aware. We might see a comment like `<!--<div>${text}</div>-->` in the template text, so we must scan comments for marker text.

A comment that matches a marker annotation is a `TemplatePart` in ChildPart position.

##### Text

Usually text-position markers will be comment nodes, but inside `<style>`, `<script>`, `<textarea>`, `<title>` tags the markup that _looks_ like a comment (`<!-- lit -->`) will just be inserted as _text_ in the script or style. So we must search for the marker as text. If found we split the Text node and insert a comment marker.

### 2.ii. Create

The create phase is performed when rendering for the the first time to a specific container or Part.

In the `lit-html` source code this phase is the instantiating and cloning of a `TemplateInstance`.

For the example this phase results in the DOM nodes being cloned into a `fragment`, ready to be inserted in the document, and a list of `Parts` that can be updated to set the dynamic JavaScript values in that fragment.

```js
const instance = new TemplateInstance(preparedTemplate);
const fragment = instance._clone();

console.log(instance._$parts);
/*
[AttributePart, ChildPart, EventPart]
*/
```

After the update phase this fragment is inserted into the DOM.

#### Create a `TemplateInstance`

A `TemplateInstance` is responsible for creating the initial DOM and updating that DOM. It's an updatable instance of a `Template`. The `TemplateInstance` holds references to the Parts used to update the DOM.

#### Clone the template and instantiate Parts

Within `TemplateInstance._clone()`, first the `<template>` element is cloned into a document fragment.

After cloning, the document fragment node tree is walked to associate nodes with `TemplatePart`s by depth-first-index. When a node's index matches the index stored on a `TemplatePart`, a Part instance is created for the node. Based on the data in the `TemplatePart`, one of `ChildPart`, `AttributePart`, `PropertyPart`, `EventPart`, `BooleanAttributePart`, or `ElementPart` is instantiated.

These Part instances are stored on the `TemplateInstance`.

### 2.iii. Update

The update step, which is performed for initial renders as well, is performed in `TemplateInstance._update()`.

Updates are performed by iterating over the parts and values array, and calling `part._$setValue(value)`.

What happens when a value is updated on a Part is determined by the parts themselves.
Every single Part type will also call `resolveDirective` very early in the logic and reassign `value` to the returned value. This is [how directives can customize and extend how an expression renders](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/directives/).

Recall that our examples `TemplateResult` contains these dynamic values for the first render:

```js
['', 0, () => render(counterUi(1), container)];
```

Which results in each of the three parts on the `TemplateInstance` being called with the associated value. For demonstrative purposes, inlined this looks like:

```js
AttributePart._$setValue('');
ChildPart._$setValue(0);
EventPart._$setValue(() => render(counterUi(1), container));
```

#### ChildPart.\_$setValue

Setting a value on a ChildPart occurs whenever the authored template has a dynamic expression in child part position, and the value is whatever has been passed into the tagged template literal expression.

Some examples of authored templates that all result in rendering `<div>hi</div>` via a ChildPart:

- `` html`<div>${"hi"}</div>` ``, sets the string literal value `"hi"` on the child part.
- `` html`<div>${html`hi`}</div>` ``, sets the TemplateResult value `` html`<p>Hi</p>` `` on the child part.
- `` html`<div>${['h', 'i']}</div>` ``, sets the iterable on the child part.
- `` html`<div>${document.createTextNode('hi')}</div>` ``, sets the Text node on the child part.

At a very high level, `ChildPart` tracks the last value it was updated with via `_$committedValue`, skipping any work if the passed value is equal to the last committed value. This is how ChildParts diff changes at the value level.
If the `value` being set on the ChildPart is not the same as `_$committedValue`, then the value is processed (differently based on the type) into a Node or Nodes and is committed to the DOM. Then the `value` is set on `_$committedValue` so the following `_$setValue` call can omit additional work if the value is unchanged.

Primitive values set on a `ChildPart`, (`null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `symbol`, or `bigint`), create or update a Text node. Committing a text node is done in `_commitText`, which is also where text sanitization occurrs.

If the value is a `TemplateResult`, then ChildPart executes `_commitTemplateResult` which renders that `TemplateResult` into the ChildPart, [creating and updating](#2b-create) that `TemplatResult`.

If the value is a Node, the the ChildPart clears any previously rendered nodes and inserts the Node value directly.

#### AttributePart.\_$setValue

In the single binding attribute value case such as `` html`<input value=${...}>` ``, an `AttributePart` also uses `_$committedValue` to not do extra work. Values are committed by calling `this.element.setAttribute(name, value)`.

`AttributePart` also handles the more complex cases with multiple bindings in attribute value position: `` html`<div class="${...} static-class ${...}"></div>` ``. Multiple values are also committed with a `setAttribute` call after the values are evaluated and joined together.

#### PropertyPart.\_$setValue

`PropertyPart` extends `AttributePart`, with the only difference being that committing the value to the live DOM is not via `setAttribute(name, value)`, but instead as a property via `this.element[name] = value`. E.g. `` html`<input .value=${'hi'}>` `` will commit the value `'hi'` with `inputEl.value = 'hi'`.

#### BooleanAttributePart.\_$setValue

BooleanAttributePart also extends `AttributePart`, and overrides `_commitValue`. When a value is committed to a `BooleanAttributePart`, a falsy or `nothing` value will remove the attribute, and a truthy value will set the attribute with an empty string attribute value.

#### EventPart.\_$setValue

EventPart also extends `AttributePart`, and overrides `_$setValue` to take the user provided event listener and then call `this.element.addEventListener(attributeName, value)`.
The EventPart ensures that event listeners are added and cleaned up between renders and if the passed in value changes.

A value of `null`, `undefined`, or `nothing` will remove any previously set listeners without adding a new listener.

#### ElementPart.\_$setValue

Nothing can be committed via an ElementPart. Instead `resolveDirective` is called, allowing directives to hook into the `ElementPart` position.

For example, [`@lit-labs/motion` has an `animate` directive](https://lit.dev/playground/#sample=examples/motion-simple) that can be applied on an element in the `ElementPart` location to then manage the elements animations.

# Efficient Updates

So far we've detailed what happens on the first render: `render(counterUi(0), container)` in the example, but what happens when the "Increment" button is clicked and `render(counterUi(1), container)` is invoked?

The `render()` function looks for a `'_$litPart$'` property on the container and finds a `ChildPart`. `_$setValue` is called on the container's `ChildPart` passing the `TemplateResult` returned from `counterUi(1)`.

The `TemplateResult` for `counterUi(1)` is:

```js
{
  ["_$litType$"]: 1,
  strings: [
    '<span class="',
    '">',
    '</span><button @click=',
    '>Increment</button>'
  ],
  values: [
    "odd",
    1,
    () => render(counterUi(2), container)
  ]
}
```

Instead of redoing the work in the **Prepare** phase, the Lit `Template` is fetched from the cache using the template's `strings` Template String Array.

> **Note**
> The reference to the Template String Array is the cache key, not the value of the key. This is an O(1) lookup and not changed by the length of the static contents.

The container's `ChildPart` stores the last committed value - which in this case is a `TemplateInstance` referencing the `Template` returned from the cache. This lets us skip the **Create** phase.

All that is left is to update the parts with the new values. For demonstrative purposes, inlined this looks like:

```js
AttributePart._$setValue('odd');
ChildPart._$setValue(1);
EventPart._$setValue(() => render(counterUi(2), container));
```

This results in the DOM updating with a green underlined number one, and the event listener is swapped with the new listener.

# Future work

lit-html is fast, but what if it could be faster!?

- [Declarative syntax for creating DOM Parts](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/990). This could remove the requirement for lit-html to walk the `<template>` element's tree and manually instantiate Parts.
- Precompiling lit-html `html` tag functions (tracked in https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/189). This provides a mechanism to move the **Prepare** step into build tooling making the initial runtime render start at the **Create** step.

# Appendix

## Parts

A `Part` is a lit-html concept and represents the location of an expression in the `html` tagged template literal:

| Part                   | Description                                                        | Authored                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `ChildPart`            | Expressions in HTML child position                                 | `` html`<div>${...}</div>`  ``         |
| `AttributePart`        | Expressions in HTML attribute value position                       | `` html`<input id="${...}">`  ``       |
| `BooleanAttributePart` | Expressions in a boolean attribute value (name prefixed with `?`)  | `` html`<input ?checked="${...}">`  `` |
| `EventPart`            | Expressions in an event listener position (name prefixed with `@`) | `` html`<input @click=${...}>`  ``     |
| `PropertyPart`         | Expressions in property value position (name prefixed with `.`)    | `` html`<input .value=${...}>`  ``     |
| `ElementPart`          | Expressions on the element tag                                     | `` html`<input ${...}>`  ``            |

In all the cases above the authored code pass an expression into `${<expr>}` which represents a dynamic binding to the template, and the different part types implement how the value is committed to the DOM. For instance the `EventPart` in `` html`<input @click=${() => console.log('clicked')}`  `` will take the user provided function, and manage `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` calls on the DOM such that the passed function is called when the click event is triggered.

Knowing about Parts is useful when [writing custom directives](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/custom-directives/#parts).
