Reverts the change in Lit 2 to pause ReactiveElement's update cycle while the element is disconnected. The update cycle for elements will now run while disconnected as in Lit 1, however AsyncDirectives must now check the `this.isConnected` flag during `update` to ensure that e.g. subscriptions that could lead to memory leaks are not made when AsyncDirectives update while disconnected.
